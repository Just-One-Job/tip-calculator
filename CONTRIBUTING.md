# Contributing to Tip Calculator

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tip Calculator! This project follows the "Just One Job" philosophy—focused, simple, and polished.

## Philosophy

This app is designed to be:
- **Simple** - One screen, one purpose
- **Fast** - Instant calculations, quick launch
- **Private** - No tracking, no analytics, no ads
- **Focused** - No feature bloat or unnecessary complexity

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion:
1. Check if the issue already exists
2. Create a new issue with a clear title and description
3. Include steps to reproduce (for bugs)
4. Specify your device/platform and app version

### Feature Requests

Before submitting a feature request, consider:
- Does it align with the "Just One Job" philosophy?
- Does it add complexity or bloat?
- Can it be done without a settings screen?
- Does it maintain privacy (no tracking/analytics)?

### Code Contributions

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow existing code style
   - Use TypeScript with strict mode
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Keep components small and focused
4. **Test your changes**
   - Test on iOS and Android if possible
   - Verify dark mode works correctly
   - Check that haptics still work
5. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. **Push to your branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. **Open a Pull Request**

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer TypeScript types over `any`
- Keep components under 200 lines when possible
- Use the theme context for all colors
- Add haptic feedback to user interactions
- Follow the existing folder structure

### What We're Looking For

✅ **Good contributions:**
- Bug fixes
